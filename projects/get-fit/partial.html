        Goal: Hackathon project where I designed a mobile app and web UI for a corporate wellness management program.
        The concept was to motivate people to exercise by paying them in cash or kind for participating in their employersâ€™ wellness program and going to the gym regularly. 
        We decided to create two interfaces, one for the employer and the other for the employee. 
        I designed a mobile app for employees to check in, and track their performance and activity. 
        For the employers, I created an web UI to help them keep records. 
        It can also be used by employees to unlock their incentives.

        The getFit logo attempts to tell a story about weight loss and being fit. In the same font family, I used semi-bold and regular fonts to create that effect.
