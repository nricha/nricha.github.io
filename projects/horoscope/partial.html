        Goal: To create visually interesting set of icons to be used in a tablet based horoscope application. The target audience for this application were females between the ages 12-18 and so the icons had to be unique and connect with the target audience. The vector icon illustrations had to have a strong graphical look and feel as well as a sense of visual uniformity. Along with designing the 12 horoscope icons, we had to design a logo and other icons relevant to the application.
