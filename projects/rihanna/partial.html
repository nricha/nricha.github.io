        Goal: To design a website homepage and navigation system for a music artist. 
        The website had to rely heavily on form and have a visible sense of function. 
        Along with creating a unique and interesting design language, the home page required to have an embedded music/video player and a minimum of seven links in the user friendly navigation system.
        We had to also re-brand the existing logo of the music artist giving it a hip and cool look.
