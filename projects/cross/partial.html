      Goal: To create a Tri-fold brochure in InDesign that incorporates a die cut. The concept had to be a personal hand held object or accessory. The die cut was to be designed in a unique and playful way to enhance the quality of the product. Along with the die cut, the brochure also needed to have a product description and high quality images that would complement the summary. The logo was to be used on the front, back and inside the brochure.
