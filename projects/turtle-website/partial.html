        Goal: To design a website for an existing non profit organization which would have a sense of value and look professional.
        The website had to include a homepage and two secondary pages which have a uniform look and feel.
        The aim was to create an updated branding, navigation system and add any primary links that the site would feature.
        The company logo along with the color scheme, photo style and type system had to be re-branded to design a fresh and contemporary look.
