        Goal: To design a tablet application based on the concept of a designers tool which can be used as a problem solver. The application had to lean heavily on form, user experience and have a clear sense of function and logic to it. The design had to be simple and user friendly. It had to include five sequential screens with the purpose of moving the user to the end goal. Social media had to be woven into the design as it would serve as a sharing feature.

        Logo

      <div class="image-summary mb-5">
        To design the logo, I started by sketching some of my ideas in thumbnail form. Once I had finalized on the general look of the logo that I wanted, I made an ideation of it. After this, I created it digitally in Illustrator.

        I felt that "fashioned", "creative", and "interactive" were the three adjectives that best described what I wanted to accomplish in this project. 
        To this end, I designed three mood boards that reflect these themes. This also led me to color scheme shown below: rustic orange, charcoal black and white.

      <div class="image-summary mb-5">
        I sketched wireframes and then created the UI prototypes shown below in InDesign. 
        Later I added details such as icons, text, the logo, background and other visual elements.
        I designed the icons in Illustrator, making sure to maintain the same design language.

          Position your logo on the chosen item. Grid-lines with snapping help you position the logo accurately.
          Try a variety of colors. Drag and swipe to rotate the object or snap view to pre-defined views (front, back, left and right).
          You can also add text to be placed on the item.
